# ADM-HW1
In this repository you can find two "*.py" files and two pdfs, which cointain respectively the first and second part of the homework.

All exercises were solved.

In the ".py" files each section is divided through commented titles. Together with the title the number of the exercises per section are shown. In the pdfs all new sections start with the first row of HackerrankSubmission table (Problem, Language, Score). The smaller sections were merged together in a pdf's section.
